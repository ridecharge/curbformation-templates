# curbformation-templates
Templates used to build AWS Cloudformation

These are all our cloudformation templates used to build up and describe our environment and applications.

The `*.json` files in the root of this repo are considered top level templates which then nest other templates find the repo to build out our environment/application.
Interactions with these templates are handled by the [curbformation](https://github.com/ridecharge/curbformation) project.
